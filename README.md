# Simple Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple calculator developed as part of an educational internship program for **InternProve**. The main goal for me was to learn and apply the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture pattern in an Android application.

While it is a basic project, it has been a valuable learning experience. Through this project, I learned how to:
- Properly utilize MVVM architecture.
- Effectively bind the UI with ViewModels.
- Manage state and user interactions more efficiently.

Overall, I have gained more insights from this project compared to some of my more complex projects, highlighting the importance of mastering fundamental concepts in building robust applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**
- **XML**
- **Android Studio**

This project was built as a native Android application using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio.
